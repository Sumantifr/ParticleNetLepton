A. Following ones are electron shower shape variables. These describe the distribution of electromagnetic shower created by the electron in ECAL. 

Electron energies are taken from a combination of crystals refered to as a supercluster (SC). It starts from a crystal passing a higher energy threshold (seed crystal) and gathering the crystals adjuscant to it in passing a lower energy threshold. 

- lepton_r9full
<- Energy sum of the 3Ã—3 crystal array centered around the most energetic crystal in the SC divided by the energy of the SC

- lepton_e1x5bye5x5
<- Energy sum of 1x5 crystal array (etaxphi, i.e. 5 crystals in phi direction) /  Energy sum of 5x5 crystal array both centered around the most energetic crystal in the SC

- lepton_sigmaietaieta
Energy weighted spread of SC in eta
Eq. 7.1 in https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/215513/1/Sirunyan_2021_J._Inst._16_P05014.pdf
It should be small for a real electron.

- lepton_sigmaiphiiphi
<- Energy weighted spread of SC in phi (similar to lepton_sigmaietaieta)

- lepton_supcl_phiWidth
<- width of SC in phi direction  calculated from covariance of SC (similar to lepton_sigmaiphiiphi)

- lepton_supcl_etaWidth
<- width of SC in eta direction calculated from covariance of SC (similar to lepton_sigmaiphiiphi)

- lepton_fbrem
<- Fraction of electron energy coming from matched bremstrahlung photon. 
https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_9_4_X/DataFormats/EgammaCandidates/interface/GsfElectron.h#L735

- lepton_hcaloverecal
<- Ratio of the hadronic energy within a cone of R = 0.15 behind the supercluster to the energy in 5x5 crystal array around the centre of SC.

- lepton_deltaetacltrkcalo
<- SC eta - (eta of electron track at calorimeter)

- lepton_dEtaInSeed
<- ele->deltaEtaSuperClusterTrackAtVtx() - (eta of SC) + (eta of seed crystal of SC)
https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_9_4_X/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/plugins/cuts/GsfEleDEtaInSeedCut.cc#L30-L33
where deltaEtaSuperClusterTrackAtVtx is difference (eta of SC) and (electron track at vertex)  
https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_9_4_X/DataFormats/EgammaCandidates/interface/GsfElectron.h#L223
so, effectively it is (eta of seed crystal of SC) - (electron track at vertex)

B. Variables related to the jet nearest to the electron
 say, 'jet' is the nearest AK4 jet to the lepton (within dR<0.4)

- lepton_jetNDauCharged
<- No. charged constituents of 'jet'

- lepton_jetPtRelv2_abs
<- Absolute value of lepton pT w.r.t the axis of 'jet'

- lepton_jetPtRelv2
<- lepton_jetPtRelv2_abs / lepton pt

- lepton_jetPtRatio
<- Ratio of 'jet' pt and lepton pt, 

C. Isolation variabkes:

- lepton_pfRelIso03_drcor
<- Relative PF-isolation (the variable you have talked about in your thesis) with the isolation cone of 0.4

- lepton_dr03TkSumPtHEEP_Rel
<- sum of track energies within dR<0.3 / electron energy

D. MVA ID

- lepton_mvaFall17V2noIso (this one i know in general, but is there a proper definition)
<- No, this is a BDT output with ~25-ish variables as input

E. Energy compatibility:

- lepton_eInvMinusPInv
<- 1./E - 1./p, where 'E' is electron energy measured in ECAL and 'p' is absolute momentum measured in tracker
https://github.com/Sumantifr/ParticleNetLepton/blob/master/DeepLeptonNtuples/NTuplizer/plugins/NTuplizer_PNLepton.C#L455

- lepton_dr03HcalDepth1TowerSumEt_Rel
<- HCAL has 2 segmentations along the radial direction. It is relative energy in the first depth around lepton with dR<0.3

- lepton_eoverp
<- Ratio of electron energy measured in ECAL to absolute momentum (p) measured in tracker

- lepton_ecloverpout
<- the electron SC energy / track momentum at calorimeter extrapolated from the outermost track state

- lepton_supcl_preshvsrawe
<- Preshower is a detector put between ECAL and HCAL to separate photons from pi0. It is ratio of electron energy in preshower and electron SC energy.
https://github.com/Sumantifr/ParticleNetLepton/blob/master/DeepLeptonNtuples/NTuplizer/plugins/NTuplizer_PNLepton.C#L461

F. Rest 

- lepton_closeTrackNLayers
<- No. of tracking layers which have hits used by electron reconstruction

- lepton_tightcharge
<- Quality of track fit
https://github.com/Sumantifr/ParticleNetLepton/blob/master/DeepLeptonNtuples/NTuplizer/plugins/NTuplizer_PNLepton.C#L252
https://github.com/Sumantifr/ParticleNetLepton/blob/master/DeepLeptonNtuples/NTuplizer/plugins/NTuplizer_PNLepton.C#L391
